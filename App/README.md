# Software_Library

The "Boom Library Management" project is a Django-based system designed to streamline the process of managing library resources. It allows users to update the borrowing status of books, search and filter through the library's collection, and provides admin features like adding, updating, and deleting books. The system is user-friendly, ensuring that both regular users and administrators can efficiently manage and access library resources.
